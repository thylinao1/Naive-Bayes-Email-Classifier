    "## 9. Results Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Log-Transform Performs Better\n",
    "\n",
    "The dramatic improvement in the log-transform model stems from **numerical stability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard approach problem:**\n",
    "- Multiplying hundreds of small probabilities (e.g., 0.0001 × 0.0003 × 0.0002 × ...)\n",
    "- Result quickly underflows to exactly 0.0 in floating-point arithmetic\n",
    "- Model loses ability to distinguish between emails\n",
    "- Falls back to essentially random classification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log-transform solution:**\n",
    "- Adding log probabilities (e.g., -9.2 + -8.1 + -8.5 + ...)\n",
    "- Result stays in reasonable numerical range\n",
    "- Model maintains discriminative power\n",
    "- Produces reliable, accurate classifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision jump from ~60% to ~98% means:\n",
    "- Standard model: 40 out of 100 flagged emails are legitimate (false positives)\n",
    "- Log model: Only 2 out of 100 flagged emails are legitimate\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the log-transform version production-ready, while the standard version would frustrate users by incorrectly filtering important emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "This comparison demonstrates a crucial principle in machine learning: **implementation details matter**. Two mathematically equivalent formulations can produce vastly different results due to finite-precision arithmetic. The log-transform is a standard technique in probabilistic models for exactly this reason."

    "2. The **naive independence assumption** that simplifies computation while maintaining effectiveness\n",

    "4. The critical importance of **numerical stability** in practical implementations\n",
    "5. How **log-space computation** solves underflow issues in probability multiplication\n",

    "- **98%+ recall**: Catches nearly all spam emails\n",
    "- **98%+ precision**: Very few false positives\n",
